# osu-rotate

Rotates osu! beatmaps 90 degrees and scales to fit vertical monitors. Provide the angle as an argument (eg. 90 for clockwise or 270 for counterclockwise). Select a song's folder in the Songs folder of osu! when prompted. Alternatively, select the songs folder itself to convert all beatmaps and place them in a folder (can take a while). Creates `.osz` files, just drag them into osu!lazer. Doesn't rotate storyboards.
